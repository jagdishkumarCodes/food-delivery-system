PROJECT REPORT
________________________________________
Chapter 1: Introduction
1.1 Project Overview
The Food Delivery Application is a full-stack web application designed to simplify the process of ordering food online. Built using the MERN stack, it offers users a seamless and responsive experience, enabling them to browse through menus, add items to a cart, make secure payments, and track orders.
1.2 Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly food ordering platform. The app aims to bridge the gap between customers and food providers by streamlining the entire ordering process.

1.3 Scope
The application is designed for both customers and restaurant administrators. While customers can browse food items, place orders, and make payments, the admin panel (optional) can be used to manage menus, track orders, and analyze sales.
1.4 Motivation
The increasing reliance on online services, especially in the post-pandemic era, has led to a significant demand for food delivery apps. This project was undertaken to learn full-stack development while building a product with real-world utility.
1.5 Target Users
â€¢	Students
â€¢	Working professionals
â€¢	Restaurant owners
â€¢	General public looking for a convenient food ordering solution

Chapter 2: Literature 
2.1 Existing Food Delivery Systems
Current market leaders like Swiggy, Zomato, and Uber Eats provide food delivery services but often charge high commissions from restaurants and do not allow full customization for small businesses.
2.2 Comparison with Our System
Feature	Existing Apps	Our App
Customization	Limited	High
Commission Charges	High	None
Open Source	No	Yes (if hosted on GitHub)
Target Audience	Mass Market	Local and Targeted
2.3 Research Gaps Identified
â€¢	Lack of personalization in current apps
â€¢	High commission for small restaurants
â€¢	Limited control for users on UI/UX
This project aims to address these gaps by offering a customizable, scalable solution.

Chapter 4: System Design
4.1 System Architecture
The application follows a standard three-tier architecture:
â€¢	Presentation Layer: React.js frontend, handling user interface and routing.
â€¢	Business Logic Layer: Express.js and Node.js handling server-side logic and API communication.
â€¢	Data Layer: MongoDB database to store user data, food items, orders, etc.
4.2 ER Diagram
The Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram outlines the core data structure of the project and illustrates how key entities are interrelated. This structured data model is fundamental in managing users, restaurants, menu items, orders, and carts effectively within the application.
Entities and Attributes:





1.	User
o	user_id (Primary Key)
o	name
o	email
o	password
o	address
2.	Restaurant
o	restaurant_id (Primary Key)
o	name
o	address
o	contact
3.	Menu_Item
o	item_id (Primary Key)
o	name
o	price
o	category
o	restaurant_id (Foreign Key referencing Restaurant)

4.	Order
o	order_id (Primary Key)
o	user_id (Foreign Key referencing User)
o	total_price
o	status
5.	Cart
o	cart_id (Primary Key)
o	user_id (Foreign Key referencing User)
o	item_id (Foreign Key referencing Menu_Item)
o	quantity








Relationships:
â€¢	A User can place multiple Orders â†’ One-to-Many (User to Order)
â€¢	A User can have multiple items in their Cart â†’ One-to-Many (User to Cart)
â€¢	A Restaurant offers multiple Menu_Items â†’ One-to-Many (Restaurant to Menu_Item)
â€¢	A Cart can include multiple Menu_Items and each item can be in many carts â†’ Many-to-Many (handled via the Cart table)
â€¢	An Order is placed by one User and includes one or more Menu_Items (not explicitly shown but could be handled through an Order_Details table in full-scale design)
 
4.3 Data Flow Diagram (DFD)
Level 0: Basic interaction between user, application, and database.
Level 1: Expands on processes like placing order, user authentication, updating cart, etc.
(Include DFD visuals if needed in actual submission.)

4.4 Use Case Diagram
Key actors: User, Admin
Use cases:
â€¢	User login/register
â€¢	Browse menu
â€¢	Add to cart
â€¢	Checkout and payment

ðŸ“˜ Chapter 7: Code Appendix (Frontend)
We won't include every line of code in the report. Instead, we'll:
âœ… Include:
1.	Overview of file structure (like the image you provided).
2.	Brief descriptions of important files/components.
3.	Selected key code snippets (not full 1000+ lines).
4.	Mention of GitHub link (if available) or note that full code is available on request.






7.1 File Structure (React Frontend) 


7.2 Description of Key Components
 

ðŸ”¹ 7.3 Stripe Integration Code
Here weâ€™ll include selected snippets for:
â€¢	Creating a checkout session (PlaceOrder.jsx)
â€¢	Handling payment confirmation (Verify.jsx)
â€¢	Any hooks or context related to Stripe (if used)


7.4 Stripe Payment Integration
ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Placing the Order (PlaceOrder.jsx)
When a user submits the delivery form, an API call is made to your backend to create the order. The backend generates a Stripe Checkout Session and returns a session_url:
let response = await axios.post(url + "/api/order/place", orderData, { headers: { token } });
if (response.data.success) {
    const { session_url } = response.data;
    window.location.replace(session_url); // Redirects to Stripe
}
ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Verifying the Payment (Verify.jsx)
After payment, Stripe redirects the user to a verification route with parameters. These are passed to your backend to confirm the transaction:
const response = await axios.post(url + "/api/order/verify", { success, orderId });
if (response.data.success) {
    navigate("/myorders");
}
